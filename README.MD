# MOONDB
MINI_project 2019-2020

Design, implement and benchmark MooDB, an efficient in-memory query engine for computing a batch of group-by aggregate queries on top of a single relation.

MooDB uses a trie data-structure to represent a relation by assuming a given attribut order, each level of the trie data-structure corresponds to one of the attributes.
